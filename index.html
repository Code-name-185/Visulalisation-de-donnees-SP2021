            <p>Democracy and other regimes are treaky to measure. There are many aspects to it, and it is difficult to apprehend them all. However, we wanted to visualize the ones we consider most important. Also, are democracy and life expectancy related ? </p>

            <p>It seems that being an OECD member, a democracy, with free elections and no barriers to parties, could be the keys to a long and healthy life. It might seem to be common sense that democracy boosts public health. In a democracy, a government that is not responsive to people's needs  can get voted out in favor of one that does. Autocratic governments face no such check.</p>

            <p>Of course, democracy doesn't insure better outcomes, many other factors have to be considered (such as ecology, technology, access to insurances etc.). </p>

        <aside> 
            <p>It was important for us to not be focused only on Europe, but to consider as much states as possible. <br>Even if a pattern emerges from this data, exceptions exist.</p>
